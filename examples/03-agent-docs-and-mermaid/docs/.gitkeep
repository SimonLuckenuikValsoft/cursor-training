# Documentation Directory

This folder is intentionally sparse. Your exercise is to generate documentation here using Cursor.

## Expected Outputs After Training

After completing the documentation exercise, this folder should contain:

- README.md - Overview of the payment service
- ARCHITECTURE.md - System architecture with Mermaid diagrams
- API.md - API reference for all exported classes and functions
- SECURITY.md - Security considerations and fraud detection flow

## Indexing This Folder

In Cursor settings, add this docs/ folder to your indexed paths to enable AI-assisted documentation search.
